# NSSpeechTest

author : jotaro shigeyama

Swift package to quickly test your mac's dictation on CLI.

Tested on Apple Swift version 5.1.3.

## Usage

Run : `swift run` in the root directory of this project.

In default this will recognize `rock paper scissors` but you can easily change them in `main.swift`

## Troubleshooting

> macOS won't dictate but show some dialog that says: "download 0 byte ..."

quick solution: In this case you can still use US(UK) or US(Austratlia) dictation kit from system preferences -> accessiblity -> voice control.
